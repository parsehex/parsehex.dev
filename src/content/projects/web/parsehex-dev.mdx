`parsehex.dev` -- that's where you are right now. Wow, impressive.

## Why?

### Social Media doesn't make sense to me

### I don't care for it, so I made this instead

I get the idea of sharing what's on your mind, but there's nothing about me that stands out among everyone else.

### I'm fucking weird, and

### I'm not getting anywhere by trying to un-weird

I'll put my shit out there and those who are interested in what they see can reach out. I don't want to keep pretending to be un-interested in stuff in order to earn people's time.

## This site should feel different than others

#### Good.

##### That's what I want.

##### [HTML Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) be damned.

AI language models have dumped unoriginal shit on me too many times, and I actively want this project to confuse AI (so far so good -- it's been awful to use agentic-coding for any of this).
