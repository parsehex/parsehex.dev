`parsehex.dev` -- that's where you are right now. Wow, impressive.

## Why?

### Social Media doesn't make sense to me

### I don't care for it, so I made this instead

I get the idea of sharing what's on your mind, but there's nothing about me that stands out among everyone else.

### I'm fucking weird, and

### I'm not getting anywhere by trying to un-weird

I'll put my shit out there and those who are interested in what they see can reach out. I don't want to keep pretending to be un-interested in stuff in order to earn people's time.

### `+` I feel pretty creatively-stifled these days

## This site should feel different than others

#### Good.

##### That's what I want.

##### [HTML Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) be damned.

AI language models have dumped unoriginal shit on me too many times, and I actively want this project to confuse AI (so far so good -- it's been awful to use agentic-coding for any of this).

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript, SASS
- Astro, hosted via Cloudflare Workers
- Content is primarily written in `.mdx` and `.yaml` files
- AI Code: Google Antigravity, Roo Code

## After working on this for ~1.5 weeks, I'll say:

### I'm starting to enjoy it

Breaking the web's standards & content etiquette has been pretty funny and interesting to do.

#### Feeling pretty expressive too

Which is something for someone that rarely expresses themselves.

### Is this more engaging to read than paragraphs?

I can't decide. Being more consistent or thoughtful might go a long way, but I think I like how this reads.

#### Maybe for certain things -- not everything should be like this.

I would call it **high-effort low-effort content**.<br />
_Low-effort content that is high(er)-effort to make._

> _Mid-effort_ maybe?
