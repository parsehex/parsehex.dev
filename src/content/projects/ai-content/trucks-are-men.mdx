### Lyrics

```plaintext
[Verse]
I don't need no books, no education
Just my truck and the highway's creation
I'm built for hard work, not some desk job fate
Got no time for sippin' latte in this eight-cylinder state

[Chorus]
Trucks are men, the only kind I'll ride
Built with steel and diesel fuel inside
No need for fancy words or polished pride
Just get me movin', the open road's my guide

[Verse]
Keep your city streets, where people pass by slow
Give me a dirt road, where my truck can grow
I'm hauling loads, from left to right
Ain't nothing too tough for this V8 tonight

[Chorus]
Trucks are men, the only kind I'll ride
Built with steel and diesel fuel inside
No need for fancy words or polished pride
Just get me movin', the open road's my guide

[Bridge]
Fuel up on adrenaline, never look back
A truck driver's life is what I lack
I'm just a man and my V8, we're all we need
We'll ride these highways, where our hearts can feed

[Chorus]
Trucks are men, the only kind I'll ride
Built with steel and diesel fuel inside
No need for fancy words or polished pride
Just get me movin', the open road's my guide
```
