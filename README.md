# parsehex.dev

This is the repo for my personal website, <https://parsehex.dev/>. It was initialized using the [Astro Minimal](https://github.com/DomeT99/astro-minimal) template created by [Domenico Tenace / DomeT99](https://github.com/DomeT99) -- if you need an Astro starter/boilerplate, [that's](https://github.com/DomeT99/astro-minimal) a good start.

## Living Project

My intent is to work on this over time to have it convey what I'm like and it'll change as I figure out what feels good or works.

- Things that I like / are meaningful to me will have their own page where you can learn about that thing, or at least what I think about it.

## Why

I have (at least) a couple problems:

- **I don't have a space of my own.** Social media doesn't interest me, but I still want to share shit about myself in the hopes to get appreciation from like-minded people and to offer interesting content to anyone else.
- **I like using AI**, but also **AI blows ass** (in a bad way). Rather than avoid it entirely, I want to learn and talk about how to use the tool without giving up the human part of it all.
