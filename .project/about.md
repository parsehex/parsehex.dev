# parsehex.dev

This is an experimental personal website built by and for a solo developer, who is the author of this document.

## Content

The majority of the content that I imagine is essentially mapping out things / information that have some importance to me -- TV shows and movies that I like, projects / tools / software that I use or make, etc. I'm not looking to thoroughly catalogue everything I can think of, but rather the things that pass the test of **"Do I give a shit about this?"**. For a specific example, I like the shows that Danny McBride (co-)creates, but I don't like `Eastbound and Down` enough to say much about it, so it likely won't be its own page.

### Presentation

I don't know exactly what I want as far as how to display this content. I can list some influences though:

- MySpace
- Wikipedia
- TiddlyWiki - Seems like TW should be a big point of inspiration as far as how to handle showing the types of content that I have and will/may have (the non-linearity in particular).

## Hosting

The plan is to have this hosted on Cloudflare, ideally keeping within the free tier.
